There also the biggest semi truck manufacturer in the world. Tesla on the other hand might make 500#000 vehicles which is almost nothing yet they are worth $430 billion over seven times what Mercedes is worth. This makes absolutely no sense at all. When the cult followers finally realized this it may be too late for them. \n  \nFor an example Mercedes builds more than 1 million trucks and vans per year. Those trucks and vans are extremely profitable# check their financials. \n \nTesla can barely get out of its own way.
