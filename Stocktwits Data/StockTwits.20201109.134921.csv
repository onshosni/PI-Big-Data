And while the mkts acted like they got what they wanted# I&#39;m hesitant to go all in. Lots of questions still need answering. Does a blue wave still happen? Does Trump drag this out for weeks or months? Does civil unrest begin and violence escalate over the outcome (something I&#39;ve been suggesting we will see)? And of course# have we forgotten about Covid-19. With that said# we are putting in this triple top just over this 3500 ish range. Now# technically speaking# triple top breakouts are big. And you can see why guys like Tom Lee see big moves coming for our mkts. But you don&#39;t usually just plowed through them. So# given the Trump contested noise# Covid-19 and potential civil unrest# I want to approach this as perhaps one more dip coming before we bust through.
