Maybe it is because people finally fear the valuation is just way too high and that eventually it will be more fashionable to short and/or sell but perhaps it is just because every car maker is now competing or planning to compete in the EV market. I just heard a GM commercial asking people to sign up to get a GM pickup truck. Almost all car commercials are now mentioning EV cars. So the luster has faded on TSLA and it is now competing with everyone. If you think only engineers employed by TSLA can innovate battery design you are sadly mistaken.',None
