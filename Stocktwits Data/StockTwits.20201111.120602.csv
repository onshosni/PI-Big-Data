That 10% market share puts Tesla in fourth place behind SAIC-GM-Wuling# BYD# and SAIC&#39;s own brand# and also puts Tesla behind the combined sales of the &quot;start-ups&quot; Li Auto# WM Motors# Xpeng and NIO# which totaled a combined 14#800 units.  \nTesla has kept monthly deliveries in the 10#000-12#000 unit range# but that is well short of the company&#39;s published capacity of 250#000 units annually in China (or 21#000 per month.) and the competition is eating into its market share.   \nTesla&#39;s year-to-date sales of made-in-China Model 3s now total 94#000 and well short of bullish WS projections. \nTesla has zero chance of delivering 500#000 cars in 2020. October data for Tesla was underwhelming in China and shockingly low in important \xe2\x80\x98green\xe2\x80\x9d car markets like the Netherlands and Norway. \n \n https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/11/10/teslas-market-share-is-sliding-in-china-and-has-cratered-in-europe/',Bearish
