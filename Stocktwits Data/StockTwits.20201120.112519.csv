Factoring in depreciation# Tesla actually had negative net capex last year# despite bringing a new factory on line in China. \nIn the first three quarters of 2020# Tesla spent just $2.01 billion on capex. While the company has promised a surge in capex in 2021# it has a lot of ground to make up.  \nChronic underinvestment and short-term strategic thinking are already weighing on Tesla. Indeed# according to the latest reliability survey from Consumer Reports# Tesla is now the second least reliable major automaker. Reversing that trend is likely to prove expensive and may undermine its ability to continue reporting positive earnings. \nhttps://www.gurufocus.com/news/1292473/tesla-the-high-price-of-sp-500-inclusion',Bearish
