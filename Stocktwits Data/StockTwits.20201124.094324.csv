Which is worth your caution.\nBe extremely cautious when gambling on weekly and same day expiry options# 80% of option holders are not exercising their contracts to keep shares but more to flip them. \n\nThe majority of options will be sold instead of being exercised against the traders margin# and the majority of the ones that do get exercised are going to be force-liquidated by brokers and the traders for a bigger dollar flip as opposed to loaning against margin rates when the borrowing/margin rate requirements are higher during election season.\n\nLong story short# today# things will decay HARD. Refrain from gambling on impulses and same-day expiries# or you will whine HARD.  Nov 20th seems to have an absurd open holding amount for options across the board. GL everyone',None
