With about $30k in my tax deferred 401(k) he wanted me to leave it there and park it in target date mutual funds. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of 8% returns/yr but they told me my goals of 50% annually were \xe2\x80\x9cunrealistic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctoo ambitious\xe2\x80\x9d I nearly gave in and let them manage my funds but it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right. So I started a $3#000 RH challenge that is now $94.5K. I also rolled the 401(K) to a Roth IRA# bit the bullet and paid the taxes. That tax deferred account is now $125k and tax free (including the gains). Plus a little $5k emergency fund that I started last year that is now $9k.  $40K \xf0\x9f\x91\x89\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb $229k growth of 472% in two years. If I had listened to the advisor# I would have roughly $49k.
