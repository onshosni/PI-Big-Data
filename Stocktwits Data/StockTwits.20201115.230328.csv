256553540,TSLA,2020-11-13T18:05:28Z,b'@bsaulness \nGenerally speaking# it\xe2\x80\x99s like an option contract in the sense by owning a warrant you are owning the right to buy a share at a defined price at a future time.  In the case of KCAC# one warrant gives you the right to buy a share at $11.50.  So# if you buy a KCAC warrant at $4# it\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent to buying a share of KCAC at $15.50 ($11.50+$4). \n\nWarrants provide more leverage.  I have thousands of KCAC warrants bc a) I believe in the co; b) I believe in the tech; c) I see QS as being the next Tesla; c) warrants provide more leverage and are currently undervalued $TSLA $NIO $RIDE $FSR',Bullish
