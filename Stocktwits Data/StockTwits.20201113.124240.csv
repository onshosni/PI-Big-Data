Their fear will get them dumping. MMs accumulate on big bearish dives. If you cant handle the swings and cant have powder back for the possible MM criminal raid we seen on stocks and even this one...move on. \n\nIf long it should be money you never need...20 years from now ur retirement....\n\nAlso being long doesnt mean you buy every little dip or chase and add more on big pops.
